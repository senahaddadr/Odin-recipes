    <h1> Grilled Watermelon Salad </h1>
    <h3> Description </h3>
    <p> Your search for the perfect summer side is over—grilled watermelon salad topped with feta and mint balances sweetness and saltiness, making it an excellent complement to a cookout or backyard barbecue. The right amounts of balsamic vinegar and salt work with a little char to make watermelon sing in a completely new way, while olive oil and black pepper tie it all together. To switch things up, try goat cheese instead of feta or serve this atop some fresh arugula, mixed greens, or your favorite salad blend. </p>

    <h3> Ingredients </h3>

        <li> ½ cup small mint leaves, torn </li>
        <li> 2 ounces feta cheese, crumbled into large chunks </li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon olive oil </li>

    </ul>
    <h3> Steps </h3>
